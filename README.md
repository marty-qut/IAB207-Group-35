# IAB207-Group-35
# List changes you do here:

# 13/10:
# Directory has been updated to include the assessment skeleton structure. - Toby

# 14/10:
# Sorted out old html files into a subfolder for posterity, can now run main.py python file in terminal to get a browser version of the site that  loosely works to a week 7/very little week 8 standard. Each page uses the {% extend base.html %} method to automatically generate headings and footers from a template. - Toby

# 15/10
# Quickly added an auctions.py file which will replicate what the destinations.py file did for the workshop website.


# TODO: 
# Proper routing for login and register pages using the authenticated method via auth.py
# Loosely defined models.py tables to enable forms for pages (as well as ) and as an extension to this: pre-generated forms using WTF quick forms instead of the hardcoded login form currently used
# Custom item page that doesn't hard-code it's content
